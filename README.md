# Stopwatch-And-Timer-Design
Verilog

I chose to build this project because stopwatches and timers are handheld timepieces that I have used countless times in the real world. As a former cross country and track and field runner, stopwatches and timers became my best friend during training and helped me succeed in the sports competitively. Being able to implement something close to my heart through my passion for software programming was really a full-circle moment and a fun experience.

My biggest challenge in this project was adjusting the clock frequencies for the four 7-segment displays needed. Without the right clock frequency for the 4 digits of the timer, the project would have always been far from complete. I tackled this challenge by not being afraid to ask for help from teacher assistants I had been in contact with and fellow classmates. I also did some learning about clock frequencies and clock dividers to fully understand the concept and through trial and error, I was able to overcome this issue.

My most significant takeaway from this project is to never look for the easy way out of a programming project because when I take the time and debug my issues or look for other ways to understand the hard/right way, then it's been an issue that I've never encountered again in my young career as a programmer. Taking the time to understand complex topics in the software world has only benefitted and motivated me in my future projects.
