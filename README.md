# Stopwatch-And-Timer-Design
Verilog

I chose to build this project because stopwatches and timers are handheld time pieces that I have used countless times in the real world. As a former cross country and track and field runner, stop watches and timers became my best friend during training and helped me succeed in the sports competitively. Being able to implement something close to my heart through my passion in software programming was really a full circle moment and a fun experience.

My biggest challenge in this project was adjusting the clock frequencies for the four 7-segment displayes needed. Without the right c,ock frequency for the 4 digits of the timer, the project would have always been far from complete. I tackled this challenge by not being afraid to ask for help from teachers assistants I had been in contact with and fellow classmates. I also did some learning about clock frequencies and clock dividers to fully understand the concept and through trial and error I was able to overcome this issue.

My most significant takeaway from this project is to never look for the easy way out of a programming project because when I take the time and debug my issues or look for other ways to understand the hard/right way, then it's been an issue that i've never encountered again in my young career as a programmer. Taking the time to understand complex topics in the software world has only benefitted and motivated me in my future projects.
